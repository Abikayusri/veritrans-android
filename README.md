## Overview

Veritrans SDK is an android library that simplifies the process of making transactions on [Veritrans Payment gateway](https://veritrans.co.id).

Please keep in mind that [VTAndroidLib](https://github.com/veritrans/vt-Androidlib) a different library than the current Veritrans SDK, and is not considered depricated and we provide no backward compatibility.

### Transaction Flow

![Transaction Flow Figure](http://docs.veritrans.co.id/images/vtdirect-mobile-flow.png "Transaction Flow Figure")

There are three parties involved in the payment process for making a payment:
* merchant,
* customers
* Veritrans.

This is how the Mobile SDK works

1. *Click Pay*: Customers enter credit card details on your mobile application, and press the button `PAY` to complete the payment.
2. *Sending data*: When customers press the button `PAY`, our mobile SDK will incorporate sensitive credit card information with a key client. The combined data is sent to the Veritrans server that is exchanged into *onetime-token* ( "token").
3. **Getting Token**: Veritrans Token will return the application to customers android phone. Token will be valid for **3 minutes** at a regular credit card transactions and **10 minutes** if the feature is 3D Secure is used. Token cannot be used again if the expired time was passed.
4. **Sending Token**: Then Token is sent to merchant server. Please note, merchant will only receive a token in as the exchange for credit card details. **Merchant should not store or process information from credit cards**. This ensures that the merchant is PCI-DSS compliant.
5. **Request Charge**: Merchant server requests a charge transaction to Veritrans using Token plus some other information (example: customer details, product details, address).
6. **Transaction Response Handling**: Veritrans returns the response status of the transaction, such as: Capture, Settlement
7. **Transaction information**: Merchant tells the transaction results to customers, ie.The purchase is confirmed.

### Prerequsites

1. Please familiarize yourself with our [documentation](http://docs.veritrans.co.id/en/welcome/index.html)
2. Create a merchant account in [MAP](https://my.veritrans.co.id)
3. Setup your merchant accounts settings, in particular Notification URL.
4. Checkout the [Veritrans SDK Demo App](https://github.com/veritrans/veritrans-android-example) and walk through the implementation.
5. Checkout the [Veritrans Merchant server Reference Implementation](https://github.com/veritrans/mobile-merchant-server), and walk through the API's that you may need to implement on your backend server.

### Security Aspects

* There are 2 seperate keys *CLIENT_KEY* and *SERVER_KEY* (available on [MAP](https://my.veritrans.co.id))
  * CLIENT_KEY is used for tokenizing the credit card. It can only be used from the Client(mobile device)
  * SERVER_KEY is *not* to be used from the Device, all API requests that use the SERVER_KEY need to be made from the Merchant Server.
* We use strong encryption for making connections to Merchant server, please make sure it has valid https Certificate.
* Please be careful logging payment related information to the Logs(especialy when using Core flow).


Following are  configurable parameters of sdk that can be used while performing transaction -

1. Merchant server Endpoint- url of server to which transaction data will be sent. This will also be referred to as a merchant server
2. Transaction details - contains payment information like amount, order Id, payment method etc.
3. Veritrans Client Key - token that specified by merchant server to enable the transaction using `credit card`. Available on the [MAP](https://my.veritrans.co.id)
